# Joomla-Programming-Task
An installable Module for Joomla 4.0
The module is a programming task given by my mentors during the selection process of the OSSP Student Program.
This module, when installed, accepts an E-mail from the user, cloaks it in the backend, and displays the cloaked email back to the user, along with a Thank You Message.
# STEPS FOR INSTALLATION:
Download the .zip file from the repo and add it to the Extensions in the Joomla! administrator->System->Extensions->Install Extensions.
The code for the module will also be present in the repoository. Make sure to check it out.
